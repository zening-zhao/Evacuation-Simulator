    <ol>
      <li>how to define the people injection algorithm?
<ol type="a"><li>for each escalator, will inject predefined number of people into this evacuation facility</li><li>people will based on same speed? or faster speed? also define senior and non-senior speed?</li><li>the all other algorithm stays same? any modification or adjustment might need to reconsider?</li><li>any other design aspect need to be considered in this scenario?</li></ol></li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="progress">Progress:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>working on existing simple scenario in parallel with the Penn station scenario. a couple of code refactoring work needs to be done to solve the hardcode issue in current C++ code. such as the layout design, exit predefine, etc. to modify current C++ code with loading Penn station layout is almost impossible since current code all layout elements are hardcoded. you cannot add complex layout with just modifying current code.</li>
      <li>also trying to make the code generic so all later modification and parameter adjustment can be done easily through configuration</li>
      <li>fixing some integration issues in pedestrian movement model now.</li>
      <li>working with Zening together to understand the full code structure and underlying logic.</li>
      <li>Zening is working with teacher in school to register the ISEF.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="next-step">next step:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>start to focus on the paper structure, each chapter's main idea and required work.</li>
      <li>any potential change of current simulation engine. including layout adjustment, algorithm tweak?</li>
      <li>continue code work and understand all required algorithm thoroughly</li>
    </ol>
